# Nuke Config
Nuke-Config is a simple but powerful collection of tools and scripts for Foundry's Nuke compositing software. 

It provides many tools and scripts to improve efficiency and quality of life while doing day-to-day compositing tasks. 

# About
Organizationally, the [tools](/tools) folder contains python scripts. Every folder in here is loaded on launch by the menu.py. There are two modules: [nuketools](/tools/python/nuketools), and [nukepedia](/tools/python/nukepedia). Nuketools are tools I have written, and Nukepedia includes a few very useful scripts from other authors (sometimes with a few modifications). [toolsets](/ToolSets) includes Nuke toolsets (gizmos as groups). Here, [jedsmith](/ToolSets/jedsmith) contains tools I've written, and [nukepedia](/ToolSets/nukepedia) includes tools from [Nukededia](http://www.nukepedia.com).
